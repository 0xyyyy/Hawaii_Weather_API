# Hawaii Vacation Weather

Using precipitation and weather data from a variety of stations in Hawaii I first loaded these CSV's into a sqlite database and then designed a number of queries to analyze the data. I then built a flask app that can be used to query start dates or a start and end date that will return a JSON list of the minimum, maximum, and average temperature for a given start or start-end range. 

### query to retrieve last 12 months of precipitation data: 



### query to retrieve available stations: 



### query to obtain last 12 months of temperature observation data(tobs):



### histogram of temperatures at station with most recordings:
